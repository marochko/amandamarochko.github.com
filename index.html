	<h1>Open Data Application: Outdoor Rinks in Ottawa (2009) </h1>

	<div class="main">
		<div class="info">
			<h3>Description and Feature List</h3>
			<p> This open data application will map out all of the outdoor rinks available in the Ottawa area. The dataset I will be using is from the City of Ottawa's website and is approximately 3 years old, however, I anticipate that there hasn't been many additions since then. The map will show where the rinks are located, via a marker-based system. From there, we will be able to see the names of the corresponding links, located on the right-hand side. In order to find out more information about the rink, perhaps exact location or other miscellaneous amenities, it will pop up underneath the map upon a click of the mouse. If you are looking for specific rinks close to your area, you can use our location bar for your easiest convenience. There is an administration log in button, located at the bottom left hand corner. In that menu, those who have admin access are able to add, edit or delete locations on the map.</p>

			<h3>User Persona</h3>
			<p>Richard: A University student, and avid hockey player. He plays within a few leagues in the Ottawa area, but with his demanding school and work schedule, finds it hard to gear up for scheduled practices and games. Hence why, the outdoor rinks are the perfect solution. He has the ability to participate in skating and hockey related activities, most likely in a closer proximity to this campus and free of charge. No extra gear is necessarg, which makes the flexibility of these venues that much more appealing. </p>
